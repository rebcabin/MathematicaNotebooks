# HDC and Eclipse-Event Materials

- The slides are in `APUforHDC_003.key` and `APUforHDC_003.pdf`

- My Belex code for the APU is in the python files (MIT licensed). We'll be
  releasing the Belex compiler under MIT soon, so you'll be able to run them
  soon. For now, I hope they're readable.

- The Mathematica notebooks are my scratch spaces for work-in-progress. I design
  my Belex code in Mathematica. They're also completely free for you to use
  however you like.
